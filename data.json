    "description": "The code uses the Tone.js library to create a simple audio sequencer with three synthesizers that play specific notes based on checkboxes arranged and selected by the user. The sound triggers the movement of particles' flowfield based on Perlin noise placed in the background."

    "name": "Step sequencer with black and white flowfield",
    "description": "The code uses a step sequencer similar to previous projects, but a different flow field is used. The flow field is created as an array where each point represents a direction vector derived from noise values based on particle positions. This field is updated in the updateFlowField function, which calculates angles for the grid points using a noise function when at least one checkbox is checked. When a checkbox is selected, it triggers a sound and randomly alters the velocity of a particle, causing it to move in a new direction."

    "description": "The numbers game was enriched with simple game functionality. The player's task is to collect all the 'strange' behaving numbers. After collecting all such numbers, the player wins. The game also was enriched with audio. By clicking a single number, the triggerAttackRelease function activates the synth sound for individual boid. Additionally, the game has background music - a looped chord sequence with a synthesizer."

    "description": "When an audio file is played (it starts on click), the code analyzes its waveform and visualizes the waveform on a canvas. The visualization involves multiple waveforms displayed in rows across the screen. The achieved effect resembles a bit of irregular radio emission lines from Joy Joy Division - 'Unknown Pleasures' album cover."

    "description": "This project is an animated recreation of Starry Night from 'Starry Night' artwork painted by Vincent van Gogh. The background particles move based on Perlin noise. The spirals rotate and shrink over time, constantly updating their positions and radii. Both background waves and spirals use createVector for positioning and movement."

    "description": "This project simulates a dynamic solar system using particles and spirals. The centerpiece is a glowing sun, around which multiple planets orbit with varying speeds and sizes. Each planet is spiral which acts like a comet during the movement. The background features particles that move across the canvas, adding depth to the scene."

    "description": "A sketchbook isn’t a copy of a specific artwork. However, it can turn into one. All it takes is a bit of imagination and moving the mouse. This sketchbook is inspired by the game 'Chase and Flee', but with a twist—the flee mechanic has been removed, and the chase feature has been adapted so that colored dots follow the mouse, leaving a trail behind. This lets the user craft their own unique artwork on the canvas."

    "description": "The project is inspired by the 'game' from 'The Severance' series. The user is tasked with catching oddly behaving numbers. When all the 'strange' numbers are collected, the user will win the 'game' (this feature has not yet been applied, but I plan to make the game fully functional while playing with Tone.js). The numbers act as a flocking system, inspired by Daniel Shiffman’s.Flocking Boids' challenge. It features a group of boys that move across the canvas, interacting with each other through alignment, cohesion, and separation behaviors. "

    "description": "Adaptation of 'The Starry Night' painting by Vincent van Gogh. I presented only the starry sky part, omitting the houses and peaks painted in the original artwork. I focused on the large use of randomness, both in shapes, position of elements, and colors. An example is the stars. In the original image, they have specific positions. In my interpretation, their positions are variable. My initial goal was to recreate the painting would be very difficult. Therefore I decided that I would use a loop and specify frameRate so that all 'random' elements change constantly. Although I was not able not copy the image 1 to 1, I wanted the composition to still be interesting in some way."

    "description": "The second adaptation of 'The Starry Night' painting by Vincent van Gogh. Here, I also captured only the characteristic sky in this interpretation. In this composition, I wanted to try out functions such as noise. Thanks to this, I achieved a more interesting effect than in the previous interpretation (in my opinion) while writing shorter and simpler code. Thanks to the combination of randomness of elements' positions, sizes, and colors and the use of a loop, the animation is dynamic and conspicuous."

    "description": "The cover of Joy Division - Unknown Pleasures album seemed to be a great opportunity to use the noise effect to create irregular radio emissions lines (Wikipedia says that they are placed on the cover), which was shown to us during workshops. During the creation, it turned out that noise can be looped noise giving a pleasant to-the-eye effect of wave animation, which fits perfectly into the cover of a music album suits perfectly in my opinion."
